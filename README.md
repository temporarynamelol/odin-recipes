This is my first project in The Odin Projects foundation pathway. 

By the end of this project I hope to have demonstrated the following skills -

    1: Use HTML to create an over all web page structure.
    2: Use the <a> tag to link relative web pages to the index page.
    3: Use the <img> tag to link images, remembering to provide an alt attribute to each image.
    4: Demonstrate the use of ordered and unordered lists using their respective tags, as well as the <li> tag.
